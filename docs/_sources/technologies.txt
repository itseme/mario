The Technologies
================

This project, as soo many of our time, stands of the shoulders of
giants. In particular, it is too mention that the server itself
is build and run in Python_ using the amazing `Flask-Web-Framework`_.

For background queueing and processing, it uses Celery_, which itself
relies on Redis_ for queueing and reporting. The Data itself is
stored in the Document-NoSQL-Database Couchdb_. And deployment
is done using Docker_.

Frontend-Side (for Mario_, the little helper), the project relies
on React_ and jQuery_.
